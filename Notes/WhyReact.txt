Why react?

-> Its composable!
-> Its declarative! - focuses on what must be done and not how ut must be done.


Imperative: Tell each step of creating a component
ex: 

const h1 = document.createElement("h1")
h1.textContent = "This is an imperative way to program"
h1.className = "header"
document.getElementById("root").append(h1)


You only need two dependencies to eun basic react! 
1.React
2.ReactDOM
